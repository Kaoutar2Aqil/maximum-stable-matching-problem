# maximum-stable-matching-problem
The maximum stable matching problem is a well-known problem in graph theory and optimization. It involves finding a matching in a bipartite graph such that the number of matched pairs is maximized, and no pair of unmatched elements would prefer to be matched with each other over their current partners.
